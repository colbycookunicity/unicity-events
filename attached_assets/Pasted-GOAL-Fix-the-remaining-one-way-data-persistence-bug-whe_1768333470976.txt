GOAL:
Fix the remaining one-way data persistence bug where phone numbers entered on the public registration form are NOT visible in the admin attendee view.

This is a write/read divergence bug.

Read Instructions.md and the entire codebase before making changes.

CURRENT VERIFIED FACTS:
• Public registration form displays a phone number after submit
• Admin attendee view shows phone as empty ("—")
• Same email + same distributor ID confirms same logical registration
• This is NOT Hydra
• This is NOT cache
• This is NOT frontend-only
• Admin is the truth: if admin doesn’t see it, it is not persisted

NON-NEGOTIABLE ACCEPTANCE:
- Phone must be stored in the SAME canonical column that admin reads (registrations.phone or equivalent)
- Any phone shown on the public form that is not present in that DB row is a BUG (ghost data)

YOUR TASKS (MANDATORY):

1) TRACE WRITE PATH (PUBLIC REGISTRATION)
- Identify the exact API endpoint handling registration submit
- Identify the exact payload property name for phone
- Identify the exact database table + column receiving phone
- Confirm whether INSERT and UPDATE both write phone
- Log the saved registration row immediately after write (id, email, phone)

2) TRACE READ PATH (ADMIN VIEW)
- Identify the exact query used to fetch attendee details for admin
- List every selected column
- Confirm whether phone is:
  • not selected
  • selected from the wrong table
  • mapped to the wrong property name

3) CONFIRM TABLE + COLUMN ALIGNMENT
- Confirm public write and admin read hit:
  • the same table
  • the same row
  • the same column
- If not, document the mismatch clearly

4) FIX THE ROOT CAUSE (NO HACKS)
- Make registrations.phone (or the existing canonical column) the single source of truth
- If admin query omits phone → fix it
- If public write skips or misnames phone → fix it
- If multiple tables or shadow fields exist → DELETE the non-canonical path
- Do NOT add syncing jobs
- Do NOT use localStorage/session fallbacks

5) DATA CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT
- Define a single Registration schema/interface
- Enforce it across:
  • public submit
  • admin fetch
  • admin update
- Ensure phone cannot silently drop on UPDATE

6) VERIFICATION STEPS (REQUIRED — DO ALL)
- Create a new registration
- Enter a phone number
- Verify:
  • DB row contains phone
  • Admin attendee view shows SAME phone
  • Admin edits update phone
  • Re-opening public form shows updated DB value

7) DOCUMENTATION
- Update Instructions.md with:
  • Root cause
  • Exact files changed
  • Before/after behavior
  • Why this bug cannot recur

RULES:
• Do NOT assume
• Do NOT say “works as expected” without checking admin
• Do NOT blame Hydra
• Fix the architecture, not the symptom

If admin and public do not read/write the same column, that IS the bug. Fix it.
