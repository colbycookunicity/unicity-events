Goal
I am trying to build a Headless CMS with Visual Editing for our Events app so admins can edit event landing pages inline (no code, drag-and-drop layout) while keeping registration, qualification, and logic inside our React app.

I want you to:
	•	Research my codebase
	•	Find relevant files and routing for event landing pages
	•	Assess how to integrate a visual, no-code page builder
	•	Design a Builder.io-style headless CMS integration
	•	Develop a clear implementation plan
	•	Write the plan to Instructions.md

⸻

What I need the system to support

Admin capabilities
	•	Inline editing of text, images, buttons
	•	Drag-and-drop section layout
	•	Reorder sections
	•	Toggle sections on/off
	•	Edit without deploying code
	•	One landing page per event (ex: /events/rise-2026)

Developer constraints
	•	React-based frontend
	•	Events app owns:
	•	Authentication
	•	Registration
	•	Qualification logic
	•	Payments
	•	CMS controls content + layout only
	•	Safe, composable components (admins cannot break logic)

⸻

Technical requirements

Please design this using:
	•	A Headless CMS with Visual Editing (Builder.io-style)
	•	CMS content fetched as JSON
	•	React components mapped to CMS blocks
	•	A single CMS model for MVP: eventLandingPage

The CMS model should support:
	•	Event ID or slug
	•	Page title
	•	Sections array (hero, agenda, speakers, CTA, FAQ, etc.)
	•	CTA button text (registration handled by app)
	•	Optional language field (en / es)

⸻

What the Agent should produce

In Instructions.md, include:
	1.	Recommended CMS solution
	•	Why it fits MVP + scale
	2.	Architecture diagram (described in text)
	•	CMS → Events App → Registration flow
	3.	Data model for the landing page
	4.	List of React components to expose to CMS
	5.	Step-by-step implementation plan
	•	SDK install
	•	API key setup
	•	Component registration
	•	Page rendering
	•	Admin editing workflow
	6.	What is MVP vs Phase 2
	7.	Any risks or guardrails

⸻

Out of scope (do not implement)
	•	Payments
	•	Check-in logic
	•	Qualification rules
	•	Email logic
	•	Styling overhaul

This is content + layout only.

⸻

Success criteria
	•	An admin can visually edit an event landing page
	•	Changes appear instantly without redeploy
	•	The Events app remains the source of truth for logic
	•	The system is extensible for future events

⸻

If anything blocks progress or assumptions are unclear, stop and ask before proceeding.
