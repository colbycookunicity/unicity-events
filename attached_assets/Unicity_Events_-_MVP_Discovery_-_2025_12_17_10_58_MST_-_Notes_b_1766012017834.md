### Summary

The meeting focused on the development of "Unicity Events," a new platform to replace Bizzabo and be operational before the early June Punta Cana trips, with Colby Cook targeting an MVP completion by early January that includes registration, check-in, purchasing, and Iterable email integration. Ashley Milliken, Biani Gonzalez, and Colby Cook decided to initially use Square for buy-in payment processing, discussed the need for on-the-fly name editing for badge printing, and emphasized the system must support tracking complex information like flight details and reimbursements. Sam Hughes outlined the long-term vision for a robust, scalable event management system, while Ashley and Biani strongly requested the platform’s database to be the source of truth with a live view and that Biani stressed the importance of easy Spanish translation for registration.

Colby Cook proposed user roles, and Ashley noted the importance of granting viewing access to market teams like Trent’s, with Ashley and Biani also noting that external team events, such as Diamond Camp, often require minimal Unicity branding. Tyler Wall advised considering badge printing a long-term goal and raised PCI compliance concerns regarding Square, and Ashley and Biani will prepare a list of all required form fields for registration, while Ashley will also prepare qualification and confirmation email content for Allison and Katie to design by early January.

### Details

*Notes Length: Standard*

* **Bizzabo Replacement and MVP Goals** The meeting, organized to discuss replacing the current events platform, Bizzabo, established that the goal is to have a new platform, tentatively called "Unicity Events," operational before the Punta Cana trips in early June. Colby Cook and the team are focused on defining the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Key MVP functionalities include registration, a check-in process, purchasing interface, and email integration using Iterable.

* **Timing and Platform Availability for Punta Cana** Ashley Milliken stated that the new platform is needed sooner than August because of the Punta Cana trips, which are in early June. Qualification for these trips begins at the end of January, meaning the new system needs to be ready to handle registration and buy-ins for qualifiers by that time. Colby confirmed that they can have the form and database set up by January.

* **Payment Processing for Buy-ins** Ashley confirmed that attendees who wish to bring a spouse as a plus one will need to make a buy-in payment. Colby suggested using Square for payment processing initially, as it is easily accessible for refunds and can integrate necessary options, with the long-term vision to eventually integrate it into the Unicity shop system. Ashley and Biani Gonzalez confirmed they need access to Square to handle refunds for buy-ins.

* **Check-in and Badge Printing** The team discussed badge printing as a necessary feature, though Colby Cook noted they need more discussion on equipment and connectivity. Ashley and Biani clarified that badge printing needs to support on-the-fly name edits during check-in, but William Hall confirmed that the current printers are not exclusive to Bizzabo. For Punta Cana specifically, there will not be a typical check-in process, but swag will be distributed.

* **Event Management System Vision and Scale** Sam Hughes outlined the long-term vision for the event management system, which is to be a robust tool capable of handling a wide range of events, from small office meetings requiring RSVPs to large conventions with ticket sales and QR code scanning for check-in. They suggested that if the software is successful enough, it could potentially be sold to other similar companies.

* **Data Management and Source of Truth** Ashley and Biani expressed a strong preference for data to be live and automatically updated in Google Sheets, rather than having to manually download and copy-paste reports from Bizzabo. Colby explained that while pushing data to Google Sheets is easy, using it as the primary database presents issues with data integrity, recommending that the new system's database be the source of truth, with the platform offering a live view similar to a Google Sheet. William suggested replacing Google Sheets entirely with customizable tabs within the new software for features like swag tracking.

* **Admin Functionality and Customization** Colby demonstrated the new system's potential for rapid administrative customization, explaining that features like customized dashboards and data editing can be implemented within an hour. Biani requested a database structure that supports customized views, such as tabs for "qualified but not registered" or "swag" lists, that highlight changes made to a registration.

* **Roles and Permissions for Data Access** Colby proposed different user roles, including Admin, Event Manager, Marketing User, and Read Only access. Ashley noted that granting viewing access to people like Trent and other market teams, as suggested by Colby, would streamline information sharing and reduce the need for constantly sending updated lists.

* **External Team Events and Branding** The discussion included events run by groups like Trent's team, such as Diamond Camp, which may not require a Unicity ID for registration. Ashley and Biani noted that these external teams often request minimal or no Unicity branding on their event pages to support social media marketing classes.

* **User Journey for Registrants** The registration process for attendees will involve finding the link via email or the events page, filling out a form (which needs to be defined), and receiving a confirmation email via Iterable. Ashley requested the ability to send emails to different categories of registrants (e.g., qualified but unregistered) and for a clear "I'm not coming" option to stop further communication.

* **Email Automation and Flexibility** Ashley requested the system include automation for follow-up emails, specifically for those who have qualified but not yet registered, to minimize manual follow-up. Biani and Ashley emphasized the need for an easy way to resend scheduled emails, as Bizzabo currently only allows automated confirmation emails to be resent, leading to messy workarounds for qualified emails.

* **Multilingual Support** Biani stressed the importance of having easy Spanish translation for the event registration, ideally through a simple button click on the page. Colby agreed to prioritize easy translation and ensure that data submitted in Spanish is captured in the same form as English submissions.

* **Flight Information and Reimbursement Tracking** The team needs the platform to handle the complex tracking of flight information and reimbursements, including collecting arrival times for transportation and receipts for reimbursement. Biani asked for the capability to check off reimbursements as they are processed, and Ashley requested that the platform allow users to upload the necessary flight documents (e.g., PDF) for finance.

* **User Dashboard and "To-Do" List** Ashley proposed creating a user dashboard where registrants can view their profile and see pending to-do items, such as outstanding flight information, to proactively address missing details. Tyler Wall added that it would be beneficial for organizers to be able to look up flight numbers in bulk to monitor delays and track time zone complexities.

* **Badge Printing and Payment Processing Technical Risks** Tyler advised Colby to consider badge printing a long-term goal, as it adds significant complexity that could derail the MVP timeline. Tyler also raised concerns about PCI compliance when using Square for buy-in payments, suggesting Stripe as a potentially easier option to manage, though Colby noted that the organization typically uses Square.

* **Immediate Next Steps** Colby stated their clear direction for building the system, aiming to have an API interface ready by early the following week and focusing solely on this project. William will assist with defining the qualification process for attendees and compiling the list. Ashley and Biani will prepare a list of all required form fields for registration.

* **Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Timeline and Structure** Colby Cook set a target to complete the MVP by early January, focusing on developing the necessary structure, including setting up a form and integrating it into a database. Colby Cook emphasized that the goal is to iterate on the MVP after the initial launch to continuously improve it.

* **Email System and Content Preparation** Ashley Milliken asked about content needs, specifically for the qualification and confirmation emails, which Colby Cook confirmed would be necessary to start putting together. Colby Cook plans to set up a meeting with McKelly to integrate the email system using Iterable once the platform is established. They instructed that the emails should be prepared in a Word document for marketing to review for translation and correctness.

* **Marketing and Design Timeline for Email Content** Ashley Milliken mentioned that marketing review could add a week to the timeline, so they decided to start working on the email content immediately. Colby Cook suggested that if necessary, they could bypass marketing to keep moving forward. Ashley Milliken will prepare the content and send it to Allison and Katie, requesting design completion by around January 4th, 5th, or 8th, acknowledging that the holiday period might make timing difficult due to staff time off.

### Suggested next steps

- [ ] Colby Cook will have the registration form and the database set up by January for the Puntaana event.  
- [ ] Colby Cook will research badge printing and discuss it further with the group, and also go to the office at the end of January to research the printers with William Hall and Ashley Milliken and determine what is required for printing badges.  
- [ ] Colby Cook will make sure that Spanish is easy to use for registration and that all information, regardless of language, goes into the same form.  
- [ ] Colby Cook will talk to the person who owns the Square account regarding payments and the refund process.  
- [ ] Colby Cook will have a separate meeting with Mcklli to tie in the API for email systems, including setting up different audiences and flows for scheduled emails.  
- [ ] Ashley Milliken and Biani Gonzalez will create a flow or funnel of preferred email campaigns for the registration process and provide Colby Cook with a list of all the fields they want to capture for the Puntaana registration form in a Google Doc, including the airfare reimbursement form and information needed from qualifiers who receive airfare.  
- [ ] Colby Cook and Tyler Wall will work on implementing an OTP login system for registration, which will pre-fill forms with known distributor information and allow for guest registration as buy-ins linked to the main distributor ID.  
- [ ] Ashley Milliken will put the content for the qualification and confirmation emails together and send it to Allison and Katie, asking for the design by early January.  
- [ ] Colby Cook will set up another meeting with McKelly to start using iterable for the email system.
