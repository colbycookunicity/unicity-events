GOAL
Automatically sync future CSV-uploaded qualified users to Iterable by adding a syncQualifierToIterable() function, without sending any emails.

BACKGROUND
CSV uploads currently create records in qualified_registrants but intentionally skip all Iterable writes.
We completed (or will complete) a one-time backfill for existing users.
Going forward, we want CSV-uploaded users to be created/updated as profiles in Iterable so they are visible and segmentable.
This must remain a silent operation with no emails sent.

CHANGE REQUEST
Add a syncQualifierToIterable() function and integrate it into the CSV upload flow so that all future CSV-qualified users are synced to Iterable at profile level only.

WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
1. Research the codebase to locate:
   - The CSV upload handler
   - The loop or batch processor that iterates over CSV rows
   - Any existing Iterable client or helper utilities

2. Implement a new function named syncQualifierToIterable() that:
   - Accepts a batch of qualified user records
   - Calls Iterable using users/update or users/bulkUpdate
   - Uses email as the primary identifier
   - Is safe and idempotent

3. The Iterable payload must:
   - Create or update the user profile only
   - Include metadata fields such as:
     - signupSource: "CSV_IMPORT"
     - qualificationSource: "EVENT_ADMIN"
     - eventId
     - eventType
     - role
     - market
     - qualifiedAt (timestamp)

4. (Optional but recommended)
   - Subscribe users to a static event-specific list for segmentation
   - Ensure this is list-level only (no campaigns, no workflows)

5. Integrate syncQualifierToIterable() into the CSV upload flow so that:
   - It runs automatically after qualified_registrants are written
   - It batches requests for efficiency (Iterable bulkUpdate)
   - Failures do not block the CSV upload itself

6. Add logging and safety checks:
   - Log when syncQualifierToIterable() is invoked
   - Log batch sizes sent to Iterable
   - Log Iterable API responses and errors
   - Ensure errors are visible but non-blocking

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- ZERO emails may be sent
- Do NOT call events/track
- Do NOT reference campaign IDs
- Do NOT trigger workflows
- Profiles and optional list subscription only
- Existing backfill logic must remain separate
- No retroactive behavior changes

DELIVERABLE
- Implement syncQualifierToIterable()
- Integrate it into the CSV upload pipeline
- Update Instructions.md with:
  - Where the function lives
  - When it is invoked
  - Why it is safe (no email risk)
  - How to disable or modify it in the future if needed
