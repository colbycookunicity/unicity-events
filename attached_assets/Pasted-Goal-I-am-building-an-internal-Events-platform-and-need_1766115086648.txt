Goal
I am building an internal Events platform and need to add a Swag feature that allows admins to manage swag items per event and track distribution to attendees.

I want you to:
	•	Research my existing codebase and database structure
	•	Identify where event admin tabs, attendee records, and reporting logic live
	•	Assess how swag should relate to events and attendees
	•	Propose a clean, scalable data model
	•	Design admin and check-in workflows
	•	Develop a clear implementation plan
	•	Write the plan to Instructions.md

Functional Requirements

1. Swag Setup (Admin)
	•	Add a new “Swag” tab inside Event Admin
	•	Admins can:
	•	Create swag items (name, description, quantity, optional size/type)
	•	Assign swag items to a specific event
	•	Set how many swag items are available per event (1–5+ items per event)

2. Swag Assignment to Attendees
	•	Each attendee can have multiple swag items
	•	Admins or staff can:
	•	Assign swag items to an individual attendee
	•	Mark each swag item as Received / Not Received
	•	Update swag status during check-in or later from the attendee record

3. Inventory Tracking
	•	Track total quantity vs assigned vs remaining per swag item
	•	Prevent over-assignment when inventory runs out (or flag it clearly)

4. Reporting & Visibility
	•	Create reports that show:
	•	Swag items per event
	•	Which attendees have received each swag item
	•	Which attendees have not received swag
	•	Remaining inventory per swag item
	•	Enable CSV export for swag reports

5. UX Considerations
	•	Swag checkboxes should be fast and easy to update (check-in friendly)
	•	Swag status should be visible on:
	•	Attendee detail view
	•	Event attendee list (icons or tags)

Constraints / Notes
	•	This is an internal admin-only feature (not visible to attendees)
	•	Keep MVP simple and extensible
	•	Avoid over-engineering sizes/variants unless necessary for reporting
	•	Assume swag is tied to an event first, then to attendees

Deliverables
	•	Recommended database schema (tables + relationships)
	•	Admin UI flow (Event → Swag → Attendee)
	•	Reporting approach
	•	Step-by-step implementation plan in Instructions.md
