GOAL
I want to fix a security and UX issue in the Distributor ID qualification → authentication → registration flow.

BACKGROUND
When a user enters a Distributor ID on the first qualification page, the system currently runs through Hydra and resolves the associated email address, which is then surfaced to the UI.
This creates a security risk because it allows potential email enumeration by guessing Distributor IDs.

Additionally, after a user authenticates using their Distributor ID, that verified Distributor ID is not consistently carried forward into the registration form, even though the system already knows it was used and verified.

CHANGE REQUEST
Update the Distributor ID qualification and registration flow so Hydra can confirm that a Distributor ID exists in the system without exposing or returning the associated email address.

After successful authentication, ensure the verified Distributor ID is automatically populated in the registration form, especially when the user authenticated using that Distributor ID.

WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
• Research my codebase
• Locate the Distributor ID qualification flow
• Identify where Hydra is called and what data is returned
• Identify where the email address is being resolved and exposed
• Identify how authentication state is persisted between qualification and registration
• Implement changes so:
  - Email addresses are never exposed during the pre-auth qualification step
  - Hydra only confirms existence/validity at that stage
  - The verified Distributor ID is securely carried forward after authentication
  - The registration form is pre-filled with the verified Distributor ID

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
• Do NOT expose or return email addresses during Distributor ID qualification
• Do NOT allow email enumeration via Distributor ID input
• Persist the verified Distributor ID using secure server-side state (session, token, or signed payload)
• Do NOT rely solely on client-side hidden fields
• Do NOT break existing authentication or registration flows
• This should be a low-risk change focused on security and UX

DELIVERABLE
• Implement the updated qualification and registration behavior
• Verify no email is exposed during the pre-auth step
• Verify Distributor ID is pre-filled after authentication
• Document the change briefly in Instructions.md
