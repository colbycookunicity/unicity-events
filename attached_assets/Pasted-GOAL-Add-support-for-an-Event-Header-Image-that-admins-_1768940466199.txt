GOAL
Add support for an Event Header Image that admins can upload per event, and have that image appear consistently on all public registration pages:
- Landing / Homepage
- Verify (OTP) page
- Registration Form page
- Thank You page

BACKGROUND
We have an Events platform where admins manage events and users register through a multi-step public flow.
Currently, events do not support a branded header image that is shared across the entire registration experience.
We want this image to be configurable per event and automatically rendered across all steps of the public registration flow.

CHANGE REQUEST
As an admin, I want the ability to upload or set an image on an event that will be used as a header/branding image.
That same image should be visible to registrants on every page of the registration flow.

WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
1. Research the current codebase.
2. Identify:
   - Where event data is defined and stored (DB schema / models)
   - Where admin event edit/create UI lives
   - Where public registration pages are rendered (landing, verify, form, thank-you)
3. Determine the best place to:
   - Add a new event-level field (e.g. headerImageUrl)
   - Persist it in the database
4. Identify all frontend components/pages that render event branding or headers.
5. Propose a clean, minimal implementation plan that:
   - Adds an image field to the event
   - Allows admins to set/update it
   - Ensures the image is loaded once and reused across all registration steps
6. Call out any shared layout or wrapper component that should be updated instead of duplicating logic.
7. Document everything clearly.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT duplicate image logic across pages if a shared layout or provider already exists.
- The image should be optional (events without an image should continue working).
- Keep the solution simple and consistent with existing patterns.
- Do not break existing events or registrations.

DELIVERABLE
Write a clear implementation plan to Instructions.md that includes:
- Files to modify
- New fields to add (DB + types)
- UI changes for admin
- Public registration rendering changes
- Any edge cases or fallback behavior
