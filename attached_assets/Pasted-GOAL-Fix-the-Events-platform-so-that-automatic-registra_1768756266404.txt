GOAL
Fix the Events platform so that automatic registration emails are ONLY sent when a user self-registers, and NEVER when an admin manually adds attendees OR uploads qualifiers via admin tools.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE AGENT
I want you to:
• Research my codebase
• Find all places where registrations or qualified attendees are created
• Identify how registration confirmation emails are triggered
• Assess why admin-created registrations and uploaded qualifiers are currently sending emails
• Develop a fix plan
• Write the plan to Instructions.md

CONTEXT / REQUIREMENTS
Current incorrect behavior:
- When an admin manually adds a person to an event, the system sends an automatic “Registration Confirmation” email.
- When admins upload qualifiers (CSV or bulk upload) to an event, emails may also be triggered.
- These emails are intended ONLY for self-registration and are causing confusion.

Correct behavior:
- The Registration Confirmation email should ONLY be sent when a user registers themselves through the public registration flow.
- Admin-created registrations must NOT trigger any automatic emails.
- Admin-uploaded qualifiers must NOT trigger any automatic emails.
- Admins retain full control over if/when any emails are sent manually.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
- Introduce or enforce a field such as `registration_source` with values:
  - 'self'
  - 'admin'
  - 'qualifier_upload'
- Ensure:
  - Public/self registration → registration_source = 'self'
  - Admin dashboard add → registration_source = 'admin'
  - Admin qualifier CSV upload → registration_source = 'qualifier_upload'
- Gate all automatic email triggers so that:
  - Registration Confirmation emails only send when registration_source === 'self'
  - NO automatic emails are sent for 'admin' or 'qualifier_upload'

SCOPE NOTES
- Do NOT change public registration behavior.
- Do NOT send emails on qualifier import, even if the user is eligible or already qualified.
- Do NOT add new email types unless required for correctness.
- Keep the fix minimal, explicit, and defensive.
- Update Instructions.md with:
  - Root cause
  - Fix summary
  - All registration sources and their email behavior
  - Any data migration or backward-compatibility handling

DELIVERABLE
- Working fix in code
- Clear documentation in Instructions.md
