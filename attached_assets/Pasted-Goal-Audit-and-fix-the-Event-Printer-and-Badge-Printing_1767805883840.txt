Goal:
Audit and fix the Event Printer and Badge Printing system so admins can reliably select printers and print badges without authorization or JSON parsing errors.

I want you to:
• Research the entire codebase
• Find all files related to:
  - Event printers
  - Badge printing
  - Check-in printing
  - Printer selection
• Identify why printers appear in Admin > Printers but not in attendee print modals
• Identify why badge print requests return HTML instead of JSON
• Develop a fix plan
• Write the plan to Instructions.md
• Implement fixes after the plan is approved

Context:
• Zebra printers are reachable over TCP/IP and confirmed working via terminal:
  echo "^XA^FO50,50^A0N,50,50^FDZPL TEST SUCCESS^FS^XZ" | nc 192.168.1.4 9100
• Printers are configured per event in Admin > Printers
• Admins attempt to print badges from:
  - Attendee details modal
  - /admin/check-in flow

Observed issues:
1. Printer dropdown shows "No printers configured" inside attendee print modal
2. Printer dropdown DOES appear during check-in, but print fails
3. Print request returns:
   "Unexpected token '<', '<!DOCTYPE'... is not valid JSON"
4. Network tab shows 401 Unauthorized responses for print-related GET requests
5. Admin is authenticated and allowed to access the admin UI

Strong indicators:
• Backend is returning an HTML error page (likely auth redirect or error boundary)
• Frontend is blindly calling response.json()
• Printer fetch or print endpoint is protected by incorrect auth middleware
• Event-scoped printers are not being joined or filtered correctly

Requirements for the final system:
• Printers assigned to an event must appear consistently:
  - In Admin > Printers
  - In Attendee print modal
  - In Check-in print flow
• Printer fetch and print endpoints must:
  - Require admin auth
  - Return JSON on success and failure
  - Never return HTML to fetch() calls
• Print requests must:
  - Validate printer belongs to event
  - Send ZPL to the configured TCP endpoint
  - Return a success/failure JSON response
• Frontend must gracefully handle errors (no JSON parse crashes)

Deliverables:
1. Instructions.md explaining:
   - Root cause(s)
   - Files involved
   - Data flow for printers and printing
   - Auth flow before vs after
2. Code fixes that:
   - Fix printer visibility across admin flows
   - Fix authorization on printer endpoints
   - Ensure consistent JSON responses
3. A verification checklist:
   - Printer visible in all flows
   - Badge prints successfully
   - No 401s
   - No HTML returned to fetch()

Do NOT:
• Change printer hardware logic
• Change TCP/ZPL printing mechanism
• Add new features

Focus strictly on correctness, auth consistency, and printing reliability.
