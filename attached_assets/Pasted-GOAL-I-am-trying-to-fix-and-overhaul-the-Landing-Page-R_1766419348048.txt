GOAL:
I am trying to fix and overhaul the "Landing Page" + "Registration Pages" system in the Unicity Events admin app.
The current UX and backend model is broken, confusing for admins, and producing 500 errors.

I want you to:
• Research my codebase
• Find relevant files, routes, database models, and API handlers
• Assess architectural and UX issues
• Identify why POST /api/events/:eventId/pages/login is returning a 500
• Propose and implement a clean, unified solution
• Write the fix plan to Instructions.md BEFORE coding

CONTEXT / PROBLEM:
Admins currently see TWO different places to edit pages:
1. A "Landing Page" editor when viewing the Event
2. Separate editors for:
   - Login / Verification Page
   - Registration Form Page
   - Thank You / Confirmation Page

This causes major confusion:
- It's unclear which page controls what the user actually sees
- The same "page builder" concept seems duplicated
- Clicking "Create Registration Page" on Login/Form/Thank You causes a 500 error:
  POST /api/events/:eventId/pages/login → 500 Internal Server Error

This is NOT just a bug — the concept itself is flawed.

EXPECTED OUTCOME (IMPORTANT):
We need ONE clear, opinionated model.

Either:
A) A single "Registration Flow Page Builder" with sections:
   - Step 1: Login / Verification
   - Step 2: Registration Form
   - Step 3: Thank You

OR
B) A single Landing Page + system-generated internal pages that are NOT editable separately

But NOT BOTH.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Eliminate duplicated page editing concepts
2. Admin should always know:
   "THIS is where I edit what the registrant sees"
3. Fix the 500 error (likely missing DB row, bad enum, or bad page type handling)
4. Backend must:
   - Create missing page records safely
   - Prevent partial / invalid page states
5. Frontend must:
   - Never show "Create Page" if the system auto-generates it
   - Or clearly explain what each page does
6. Update copy + labels to remove ambiguity ("Landing Page" is probably the wrong term)

DELIVERABLES:
1. Instructions.md with:
   - Root cause analysis (UX + backend)
   - Recommended architecture (with reasoning)
   - Data model changes (if needed)
   - API changes
   - UI changes
2. Then implement the fix cleanly

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT hack around the error
- Do NOT add conditionals without understanding the model
- Favor simplicity, fewer concepts, fewer page types

START BY:
- Tracing how pages are stored (DB schema)
- Tracing how page types are created
- Identifying why /pages/login POST fails
- Mapping admin navigation → actual user-facing URLs
