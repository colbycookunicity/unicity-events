GOAL
Add admin-only authentication to the existing PubMed Research Ingestion System so that only approved admin users can log in and perform actions. There is NO public user registration.

BACKGROUND
This application is an internal research ingestion and review tool. We need authentication only to:
- Identify which admin is performing actions
- Control access to admin-only pages
- Attribute approvals, rejections, and notes to a specific admin

There must be NO self-service signup or public authentication.

CHANGE REQUEST
Implement an admin-only authentication system with the following requirements:

1) Admin User Model
Create an `admins` table with:
- id
- email (unique)
- password_hash
- name
- role (admin / super_admin)
- is_active
- last_login_at
- created_at
- created_by_admin_id (nullable)

Admins will be added manually (via seed script or admin-only UI later).

2) Authentication Method
- Email + password login
- Passwords must be securely hashed
- No registration endpoint
- No password reset flow for now (manual reset only)

3) Sessions & Authorization
- Use session-based authentication (preferred for admin tools)
- Create middleware: `requireAdmin`
- Protect all admin routes and APIs
- Redirect unauthenticated users to `/login`

4) Login UI
Create a simple login page:
- Email
- Password
- Error handling for invalid credentials
- Loading state

5) Admin Context
Once logged in:
- Store admin ID in session
- Make admin info available to frontend
- Display logged-in admin name in the UI

6) Audit Trail Integration
Update existing admin actions to store:
- approved_by (admin id)
- rejected_by (admin id)
- reviewed_by (admin id)

Ensure all approvals, rejections, and notes are attributable to a specific admin.

WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
- Review the existing codebase and architecture
- Identify where authentication should live
- Add the admin table and migrations
- Implement login, logout, and session handling
- Protect admin routes and APIs
- Update admin actions to record which admin performed them
- Write documentation in Instructions.md explaining:
  - How admins are created
  - How login works
  - How access is enforced

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- No public user accounts
- No signup or registration flow
- Keep the system simple and secure
- Must work cleanly in a Replit deployment
- Do not over-engineer (no OAuth unless necessary)

DELIVERABLE
- Admin login page
- Admin authentication backend
- Protected admin routes
- Admin attribution on review actions
- Updated Instructions.md documentation
