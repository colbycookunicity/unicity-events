Goal:
Fix swag assignment persistence so assigned swag is correctly saved, retrievable, and reliable.

Read Instructions.md and all swag-related frontend, API, and database files fully before making changes.

Context:
• Swag assignments are created via an admin UI
• Swag assignments should be persisted in the `swag_assignments` table
• The `swag_assignments` table is currently empty
• Assignments are not being saved at all
• The issue may exist in UI state handling, API wiring, or database insert logic
• Existing swag data models and tables should be reused

Scope:
• Swag assignment UI
• API endpoints or service logic responsible for saving swag assignments
• Database insert and retrieval logic for `swag_assignments`

What to investigate:
1. Trace the swag assignment flow end-to-end (UI → API → database)
2. Verify the swag assignment action triggers an API call
3. Confirm the request payload includes all required assignment data
4. Verify the backend handler receives the payload correctly
5. Confirm database insert logic for `swag_assignments` exists and is executed
6. Identify why no records are being written
7. Fix the persistence logic so assignments are saved correctly
8. Verify assigned swag can be retrieved after reload

Rules (critical):
• Do NOT refactor unrelated code
• Do NOT change database schema unless absolutely required
• Do NOT add new UI unless necessary to complete the fix
• Use existing services, routes, and models where possible
• Keep changes minimal and scoped to swag assignment functionality
• Log errors clearly if assignment saving fails

Testing requirements:
• Assign swag via the admin UI
• Verify record is written to `swag_assignments`
• Reload and confirm assignment persists
• Confirm no duplicate or partial records are created
• Validate retrieval logic returns correct assignments

Output:
• Swag assignments are saved correctly to `swag_assignments`
• Assignments persist across reloads
• No regression to existing functionality
• Clear logging for assignment creation failures
