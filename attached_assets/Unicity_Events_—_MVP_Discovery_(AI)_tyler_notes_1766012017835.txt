Based on the discussion, here are the high-level requirements and notes for the **Punta Cana MVP**, targeted for launch by **January 1st or 2nd**.

### 1. Core Objectives

* 
**Goal:** Replace "Bizzabo" with a custom internal platform to save costs and better integrate with Unicity data.


* 
**Target Event:** Punta Cana (Early June).


* 
**MVP Deadline:** Registration form and database must be live by early January to capture qualifiers.


* 
**Long-Term Vision:** Treat event data as first-class Unicity data (history, recognition, compliance) rather than isolated third-party records.



### 2. Registration & Authentication

* **Login Method:** Use **OTP (One-Time Password)** or Magic Link tied to the Distributor ID and email. Avoid password management.


* 
**Validation:** Validate the user against their Unicity Distributor ID.


* **Guest/Spouse Handling:**
* "Plus Ones" do not have Unicity IDs.


* Guests must be linked to the primary Distributor's ID (e.g., as a sub-record or via a "G" suffix).


* Distributors typically pay for and register their own guests.




* 
**Translations:** **English and Spanish** support is a critical "top goal" for launch.



### 3. Payments (Buy-Ins)

* **Requirement:** Need to process payments for "Buy-ins" (guests/spouses) directly in the flow .
* 
**Provider Decision Needed:** The team currently uses **Square**, but Tyler recommended **Stripe** to reduce PCI compliance headaches and handle API integrations easier.


* 
**"No-Show" Fees:** The system needs the ability to collect credit card info for a potential "no-show fee" (even if they aren't actually charged, it’s used as a deterrent).



### 4. Logistics & Data Collection

* **Flights & Airfare:**
* 
**Data Needed:** Airline, Flight Number, Departure City, Arrival City.


* 
**Reimbursement:** Qualifiers need to upload a **PDF receipt** of their flight for finance to process.


* 
**Status Tracking:** Admins need a checkbox to mark "Reimbursement Complete".


* 
**Wishlist:** Integration with **FlightAware** to auto-check arrival times and delays (Tyler/Colby to explore).




* **Swag Management:**
* Collect shirt sizes during registration.


* 
**On-site feature:** A simple admin toggle to mark "Swag Picked Up" to prevent disputes about who received their items.





### 5. Communication (Iterable Integration)

* 
**Platform:** Integration with **Iterable** is required (Mikele to provide API).


* **Required Automated Flows:**
* 
**Confirmation:** Immediate email upon registration.


* 
**Nudge:** "You qualified but haven't registered" (sent repeatedly).


* 
**Resend Capability:** Admins need a button to manually "Resend Confirmation" or "Resend Qualification Email" if a user claims they missed it (current Bizzabo pain point).





### 6. Admin Dashboard Requirements

* 
**Role-Based Access:** Admins (edit capability) vs. Viewers (Market-specific read-only access).


* 
**Filtering:** Ability to filter attendees by status (Registered, Not Coming, Swag Picked Up, Reimbursement Pending).


* **User Management:** Ability to edit names/details on the fly .

### 7. Out of Scope (For Now)

* **On-Site Badge Printing:** De-scoped for the MVP. Punta Cana will likely use pre-printed or manual solutions; printing is a long-term goal for larger events like Convention.


* 
**Side Events (Diamond Camp):** While mentioned as a future need, the immediate focus is strictly Punta Cana.
