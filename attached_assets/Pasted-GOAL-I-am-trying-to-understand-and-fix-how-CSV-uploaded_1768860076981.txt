GOAL
I am trying to understand and fix how CSV-uploaded attendees are handled for Qualified-Only events (OTP required) in our Events platform.

CURRENT PROBLEM
I uploaded ~60 users via CSV into a Qualified-Only event in production.
These users ARE intended to be qualified and allowed to register.
However, when viewing the Attendees list, they show no visible "Qualified" status or indicator.
Additionally, emails must NOT be sent to these users until they have actually registered or are explicitly marked as registered.

I want to confirm:
1) Whether CSV-uploaded attendees are being correctly marked as qualified
2) Whether qualification is implicit vs explicit in the data model
3) Why the UI shows no qualification state
4) That no emails are triggered for uploaded attendees unless they register

WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
• Research my codebase
• Find the relevant files, database tables, and logic related to:
  - CSV attendee uploads
  - Qualified-only events
  - OTP verification
  - Attendee qualification state
  - Email triggering logic
• Determine whether uploaded attendees SHOULD be explicitly marked as `qualified = true`
  or whether qualification is inferred another way
• Identify why the Admin Attendees UI shows no qualification indicator
• Verify that NO emails are sent on:
  - CSV upload
  - Admin “Add Person”
  - Qualification import
• Identify any bugs, missing flags, or incorrect assumptions
• Develop a clear fix plan
• Write the plan to Instructions.md

SPECIFIC AREAS TO INVESTIGATE
• server/routes/admin (CSV upload endpoints)
• qualification / qualifiedRegistrants logic
• registration vs qualification vs pending states
• attendee table fields (qualified, registered, status, etc.)
• email triggers (Iterable / event hooks)
• UI logic that determines what status is shown in the Attendees list

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
• Qualified-only events must allow ONLY these users to register
• Uploaded users should NOT receive emails until they complete registration
• “Qualified” should either be:
  - Clearly visible in the admin UI, OR
  - Clearly documented as implicit behavior (if intentional)

DELIVERABLE
Write a clear diagnosis and step-by-step fix plan to Instructions.md.
If there are multiple valid approaches, document the tradeoffs and recommend one.

Do NOT make changes yet — only analyze and write the plan.
