Goal:
Add Apple Wallet (PassKit) support so registered users can add their event QR code to Apple Wallet.

Context:
We already have:
• Per-registration check-in QR codes with payload format:
  CHECKIN:<eventId>:<registrationId>:<token>
• QR codes rendered on the registration success page
• QR codes included in the registration confirmation email
• A QR scanner that validates tokens and checks users in
• Badge printing handled separately

Apple Wallet should present the SAME QR payload (no new tokens).

I want you to:
• Add server-side Apple Wallet (.pkpass) generation using PassKit
• Create a Wallet pass that includes:
  - Event name
  - Event date (if available)
  - Attendee name
  - QR code with payload:
    CHECKIN:<eventId>:<registrationId>:<token>
• Use PKBarcodeFormatQR with iso-8859-1 encoding
• Add an endpoint:
  GET /api/wallet/:checkinToken
  that:
    - Validates the token
    - Generates and returns a signed .pkpass file
    - Sets Content-Type to application/vnd.apple.pkpass
• Ensure the Wallet pass works offline once added
• Add an “Add to Apple Wallet” button that links to this endpoint:
  - On the registration success page
  - In the registration confirmation email (iOS-only if possible)
• Reuse the existing check-in token (do NOT generate new tokens)
• Ensure scanning the Wallet QR triggers the existing check-in flow

Certificate handling:
• Assume Apple Wallet certificates (Pass Type ID, cert, private key) will be provided via environment variables
• Do NOT hardcode secrets
• Document required env vars clearly

Constraints:
• Do NOT modify QR payload format
• Do NOT modify QR scanner logic
• Do NOT modify badge printing logic
• Do NOT add new auth systems
• Do NOT change admin or attendee portal flows
• Touch only Wallet-related functionality

Output:
• Wallet pass generation logic
• New API endpoint for Wallet pass delivery
• UI + email updates to include “Add to Apple Wallet”
• Clear explanation of how Wallet integrates with existing QR logic
• Update Instructions.md with a section titled:
  “Apple Wallet Check-In Pass”
