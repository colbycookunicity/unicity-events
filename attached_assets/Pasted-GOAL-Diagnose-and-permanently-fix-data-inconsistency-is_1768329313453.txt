GOAL:
Diagnose and permanently fix data inconsistency issues between the Events public registration form, Admin attendee view, and user verification flows.

This includes mismatched phone numbers, missing distributor IDs, and fields appearing on the public registration page that do NOT appear in admin.

Read Instructions.md and the entire codebase before making changes.

CONTEXT:
• events.unicity.com is a custom Events platform
• Users authenticate via email / magic link
• Events have:
  - Public registration routes (/register/:slug)
  - Admin-managed attendee records
• There is NO intentional phone-number source other than what the user enters during registration
• Hydra is NOT the source of these phone numbers (do not assume Hydra owns this data)
• The same user email is showing different phone values depending on view
• Admin updates do NOT reflect on public registration page
• Public page shows persisted values even after admin edits
• A second test user shows missing name/phone/UID on public form but data exists in admin

KNOWN SYMPTOMS:
1. Public registration form displays a phone number not visible in admin
2. Updating phone in admin does not update public registration view
3. Updating phone on public registration persists but is invisible to admin
4. Distributor ID exists in admin but not on public page
5. qualifier-info endpoint is returning 404
6. Multiple users show inconsistent field hydration

YOUR TASKS (DO ALL OF THESE):

1. DATA SOURCE AUDIT (MANDATORY)
   - Trace ALL possible sources of:
     • phone
     • name
     • distributorId
   - Explicitly identify:
     • database tables
     • API endpoints
     • client-side persistence (localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies)
     • prefill logic in frontend components
   - Write a clear "Source of Truth Map" in Instructions.md

2. PUBLIC FORM PREFILL TRACE
   - Find exactly how the public registration form is populated
   - Identify whether it is using:
     • cached user profile
     • verification payload
     • previous registration record
     • local/session storage
   - Log the exact code path that injects the phone into the form

3. ADMIN ↔ PUBLIC DATA DESYNC
   - Identify why admin updates do not propagate to public views
   - Identify whether admin and public are:
     • writing to different tables
     • using different schemas
     • reading through different APIs
   - Confirm with concrete evidence (queries + code references)

4. QUALIFIER INFO ENDPOINT
   - Investigate `/api/public/qualifier-info/:slug`
   - Determine why it is returning 404
   - Determine whether its failure causes fallback behavior or stale data usage
   - Fix or remove broken dependency

5. SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH FIX
   - Enforce ONE canonical source for attendee data
   - Ensure:
     • public form reads from it
     • admin reads from it
     • admin writes update it
     • public edits update it
   - Eliminate shadow copies, stale hydration, or client-side persistence

6. DATA NORMALIZATION RULES
   - Ensure empty fields are not silently overridden
   - Ensure distributorId cannot disappear between views
   - Ensure phone updates always overwrite previous values

7. SAFETY + LOGGING
   - Add defensive logging where data is hydrated into forms
   - Make mismatches observable in logs (not silent)

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
• Write a detailed diagnosis in Instructions.md
• Include:
  - exact files
  - exact functions
  - exact tables
  - before/after data flow diagrams (text is fine)
• Implement the fix
• Do NOT guess
• Do NOT assume Hydra
• Do NOT patch with hacks or localStorage
• If multiple bad patterns exist, delete the bad ones instead of layering fixes

If something blocks you, document it clearly instead of working around it.
