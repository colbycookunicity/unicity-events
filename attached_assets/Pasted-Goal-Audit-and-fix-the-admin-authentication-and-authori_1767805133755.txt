Goal:
Audit and fix the admin authentication and authorization system so that only explicitly approved admins can access the admin dashboard, and non-admin users are never inserted into admin settings.

I want you to:
• Research the entire codebase
• Find all files related to admin login, OTP auth, and admin authorization
• Identify where admin access is checked and where admin users are created
• Detect any logic that auto-creates or upserts admin users
• Ensure a single source of truth for admin access
• Develop a fix plan
• Write the plan to Instructions.md
• Implement the fixes after the plan is approved

Context:
• There is an Admin Login page that sends OTP codes
• There is an Admin Users table with roles:
  - administrator
  - read_only
• Only users explicitly added via the Admin Users UI should exist in this table
• Non-admin users (attendees, registrants, test users) must NEVER be added to admin_users
• "Read Only" is a role for admins only, not a fallback role for normal users

Current bugs to investigate:
1. A valid admin (carolina.martinez@unicity.com) is blocked at admin login with "Access Denied"
2. A non-admin test user (colby.cook+001@unicity.com) was incorrectly added to Admin Users as "Read Only"
3. Admin Login authorization appears to be using a different check than the Admin Users table

Requirements for the final system:
• Admin login must check ONLY the admin_users table
• If email does not exist in admin_users → Access Denied (no inserts, no upserts)
• Admin users must only be created via the Admin Users UI by an existing administrator
• No login flow, OTP flow, or middleware may create admin_users records
• Role values must be normalized and consistently enforced
• Email comparison must be case-insensitive

Deliverables:
1. Instructions.md explaining:
   - Root cause(s)
   - Files involved
   - Authorization flow before vs after
2. Code changes that:
   - Remove any auto-creation of admin users
   - Unify admin auth checks
   - Prevent non-admins from ever appearing in Admin Users
3. Confirmation checklist to verify the fix

Do not add new features.
Do not change attendee or registration flows.
Focus strictly on correctness, security, and separation of admin vs user access.
