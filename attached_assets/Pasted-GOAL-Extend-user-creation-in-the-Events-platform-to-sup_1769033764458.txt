GOAL
Extend user creation in the Events platform to support a strongly-typed EventsSignupContext object, while setting signupSource to "EVENTS_APP" for all Events-originated users.

BACKGROUND
Users created via the Events application are currently stored with:
signupSource = "API"

We already agreed to change this to:
signupSource = "EVENTS_APP"

We now want to formalize and enforce a structured signupContext specifically for Events using a typed interface, so event-related metadata is consistent, queryable, and future-proof.

CHANGE REQUEST
1. Ensure all users created via the Events application explicitly set:
   signupSource = "EVENTS_APP"

2. Add support for a typed signupContext object that follows this interface:

   interface EventsSignupContext {
     eventId: string;
     eventType: "METHOD" | "SKILL_SCHOOL" | "DIAMOND_CAMP";
     market: string;
     role: "attendee" | "guest" | "admin_added";
   }

3. signupContext should be optional, nullable, and stored as a JSON / object field.
   - It should only be populated for Events-created users.
   - Other user creation flows should remain unchanged.

WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
- Research the codebase to locate:
  - The user creation service/function
  - All Events-related user creation entry points (registration flow, admin add, qualification → registration flow)

- Update the Events user creation logic to:
  - Pass signupSource = "EVENTS_APP"
  - Pass a signupContext object conforming to EventsSignupContext

- Ensure the core user creation service:
  - Accepts signupContext as an optional parameter
  - Defaults signupSource to "API_GENERIC" if no explicit source is provided
  - Does NOT enforce EventsSignupContext for non-Events callers

- Add or update TypeScript typings so:
  - EventsSignupContext is explicitly defined
  - signupContext is typed as EventsSignupContext | null in Events code paths
  - Generic user code treats signupContext as unknown / JSON

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT backfill or modify existing users
- Do NOT overwrite signupSource for existing records
- Do NOT break non-Events user creation flows
- signupContext must be optional and nullable
- Keep naming, enums, and file structure consistent with the existing codebase

DELIVERABLE
1. signupSource correctly set to "EVENTS_APP" for Events-created users
2. EventsSignupContext interface added and used in Events flows
3. signupContext persisted as structured JSON
4. Summary of files changed and confirmation that no backfill was performed
