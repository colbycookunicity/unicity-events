GOAL:
Fix inaccurate practice time tracking when sessions are interrupted (loss of data, power, app closed early), and prevent inflated or incorrect session durations from being saved.

CONTEXT:
User feedback indicates that when a Method session is interrupted (traveling, low data, battery loss, or accidental close), the timer continues running or saves incorrect values.
Examples:
• Hundreds of minutes recorded when only ~20 minutes were completed
• Evening session recorded as 20 seconds when closed early
• Timer keeps ticking when app loses focus or connection

This affects trust, streak accuracy, and analytics.

INSTRUCTIONS:
• Research the entire codebase
• Find all practice session timing logic (Morning, Evening, Practice Mode)
• Identify where timers start, pause, resume, and stop
• Inspect how elapsed time is calculated and persisted
• Check behavior on:
  - App backgrounding
  - Browser tab close
  - Network disconnect
  - Power loss / refresh
• Verify whether timers rely on client-side intervals instead of timestamps
• Identify any missing cleanup on unmount or visibility change
• Inspect session save logic for:
  - Minimum duration validation
  - Maximum duration sanity checks
  - Early exit handling
• Compare intended duration vs recorded duration
• Review how partial sessions should be treated (discard, cap, or save)

REQUIREMENTS / FIXES:
• Timer must pause or stop when app loses focus, connection, or visibility
• Use timestamp-based duration calculation (startTime → endTime), not raw ticking intervals
• Prevent unrealistic durations from being saved (e.g., multi-hour accidental sessions)
• Clearly handle early exits:
  - Option A: discard sessions under X seconds
  - Option B: save but mark as partial
• Ensure UI reflects actual saved duration, not optimistic values
• Add logging for interrupted or abnormal sessions
• Ensure streak logic is not broken by partial sessions

DELIVERABLES:
• Root cause explanation
• File + line references
• Clear fix plan
• Implement the fixes
• Add safeguards against bad data
• Update Instructions.md with findings before finalizing
