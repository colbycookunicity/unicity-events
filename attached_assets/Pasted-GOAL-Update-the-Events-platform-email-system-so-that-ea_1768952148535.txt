GOAL
Update the Events platform email system so that each email type per event uses a single Iterable campaign, and language selection is handled entirely by locale (e.g., en-US, es-US) sent to Iterable — not by separate English/Spanish campaign mappings.

BACKGROUND
Currently, the Events platform allows admins to select separate English and Spanish Iterable campaigns per email type (Registration Confirmation, Check-In, Qualification Granted, etc.).

This is no longer the desired architecture.

Iterable already supports locale-based rendering within a single campaign, and we can configure localized templates (en-US, es-US, etc.) directly inside Iterable.

Therefore:
- The Events platform should only reference ONE Iterable campaign per email type per event.
- The platform must send the attendee’s locale (e.g., en-US, es-US) to Iterable so Iterable selects the correct localized template.
- Language logic should NOT be controlled in the Events admin UI.

WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
1. Research the current codebase:
   - Identify where email campaign mappings are stored (event config, DB schema, admin UI).
   - Identify where Iterable events are triggered and payloads are constructed.
   - Locate how language or Spanish/English selection is currently determined.

2. Update the data model and admin UI:
   - Remove or deprecate separate English Campaign and Spanish Campaign fields.
   - Replace them with a single campaign selector per email type (e.g., registration_confirmation_campaign_id).
   - Ensure existing events migrate cleanly (pick English as default if both exist).

3. Update Iterable payload logic:
   - Confirm that a `locale` field is sent with every Iterable event (examples: "en-US", "es-US").
   - Locale should be derived from the registrant’s language/market (existing logic if present).
   - Ensure locale is included consistently for:
     - Registration Confirmation
     - Check-In Notification
     - Qualification Granted
     - Registration Canceled
     - Any other email-triggering events

4. Ensure correct behavior:
   - Iterable receives ONE campaign ID per email type.
   - Iterable selects the correct localized template based on `locale`.
   - No language branching logic remains in the Events platform.

5. Clean up:
   - Remove unused Spanish/English campaign fields from UI and backend.
   - Update any types, validations, or admin forms accordingly.

DELIVERABLE
- A clear implementation plan written to Instructions.md
- Code changes that:
  - Simplify email campaign configuration to one campaign per email type
  - Reliably send `locale` to Iterable
- Confirmation notes in Instructions.md explaining:
  - How locale is determined
  - What Iterable expects
  - How admins should now configure email campaigns going forward
