GOAL
Perform a one-time backfill to create Iterable user profiles for CSV-uploaded qualified users WITHOUT sending any emails.

BACKGROUND
Users uploaded via CSV are stored in the qualified_registrants table and were intentionally not synced to Iterable.
As a result, these users do not exist in Iterable at all (no profile, no list membership).
We now want these users to exist in Iterable for segmentation and visibility purposes only.
This is a one-time backfill. Future CSV uploads should remain unchanged.

CHANGE REQUEST
Implement a one-time backfill script/process to create or update Iterable user profiles for existing qualified_registrants records.

WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
1. Research the codebase and database to identify:
   - The qualified_registrants table
   - Fields available per record (email, eventId, role, market, etc.)
   - Any existing Iterable utilities or clients

2. Build a one-time backfill process that:
   - Iterates over existing qualified_registrants
   - Creates or updates users in Iterable using:
     - users/update or users/bulkUpdate
   - Uses email as the primary identifier

3. Ensure the backfill is SILENT:
   - Do NOT call events/track
   - Do NOT reference campaign IDs
   - Do NOT trigger workflows
   - Do NOT subscribe users to marketing campaigns
   - User creation only (profile-level write)

4. Add clear tagging to the Iterable profile to indicate origin, for example:
   - signupSource: "CSV_IMPORT"
   - qualificationSource: "EVENT_ADMIN"
   - eventId
   - role
   - market
   - backfilledAt (timestamp)

5. Add safety instrumentation:
   - Log total users scanned
   - Log total users written to Iterable
   - Log any Iterable API errors
   - Sample-log a small number of emails for verification

6. Ensure the process is:
   - Idempotent (safe to run once without duplicates)
   - Manually invoked (script or admin-only route)
   - Clearly marked as ONE-TIME USE

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- ZERO emails may be sent
- No campaign triggers
- No future CSV behavior changes
- No automatic syncing added to CSV uploads
- This is a one-time backfill only

DELIVERABLE
- Write the backfill plan and implementation details to Instructions.md
- Include:
  - Exact Iterable API calls used
  - Confirmation that no email-triggering endpoints are used
  - How to safely execute the backfill
  - Expected results after completion (users searchable in Iterable)
