GOAL
Fix a first-load bug on /my-events where all registered events do not appear
until the page is hard-refreshed.

BACKGROUND
User: colby.cook+tobias@unicity.com

Observed behavior:
- User is properly registered for:
  • Las Vegas Method Seminar (Registered)
  • Skills Academy (Qualified / Action needed)
- On FIRST page load of /my-events:
  → Only Skills Academy appears
  → Las Vegas Method is missing
- On HARD REFRESH:
  → Both events appear correctly

This confirms the data exists and the backend is correct.
The issue is related to first-load client-side state, caching, or hydration.

WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
1. Investigate the /my-events page lifecycle:
   - Initial render
   - Data fetching (API calls)
   - State initialization
   - Re-renders after auth/session resolution

2. Identify all relevant files including:
   - Frontend page/component for /my-events
   - API hook or fetch logic used to load events
   - Auth/session resolution logic (email, userId, token)
   - Any useEffect / useQuery / SWR / React Query logic

3. Specifically look for common first-load failure patterns:
   - API call firing BEFORE user/session is fully resolved
   - Cached empty response being reused
   - Missing dependency array values in useEffect
   - Race condition between auth state and event fetch
   - Client-side filtering running on partial data
   - Stale memoized values (useMemo / useCallback)
   - Conditional fetches that only rerun on refresh

4. Confirm:
   - What API response is returned on first load
   - Whether the Method event is missing from the API OR filtered out on the client
   - Whether a second render should trigger but doesn’t

5. Implement the fix so that:
   - /my-events ALWAYS loads complete, correct data on first visit
   - No hard refresh is required
   - Both registered and pending events appear reliably

6. Add temporary logging (if helpful) to confirm:
   - When auth is ready
   - When the events fetch fires
   - What data is returned and rendered

7. Remove any temporary logs once verified.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT add artificial delays or timeouts
- Fix the root cause, not the symptom
- Avoid double-fetching unless required
- Maintain performance and clean render flow

DELIVERABLES
1. Root cause explanation (why first load fails)
2. Code fix that resolves the issue
3. Verification steps (fresh login, no hard refresh)
4. Summary written to Instructions.md
