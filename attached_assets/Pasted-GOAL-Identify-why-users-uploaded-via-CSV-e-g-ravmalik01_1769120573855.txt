GOAL
Identify why users uploaded via CSV (e.g. ravmalik01@gmail.com) were not created as users in Iterable.

BACKGROUND
Admins can upload CSV files to add qualified users to events.
These users should be created or updated in Iterable (user profile + list/segment membership),
but should NOT receive any emails.
When searching in Iterable, the user ravmalik01@gmail.com does not exist at all.

CHANGE REQUEST
Investigate the CSV upload → backend → Iterable integration to determine why users are not being created in Iterable.

WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO
1. Research the codebase and locate:
   - The CSV upload handler
   - The code path that processes each CSV row
   - Any functions responsible for creating or updating users in Iterable

2. Trace the full data flow for a single CSV row:
   CSV upload
   → parsing / validation
   → database writes (if any)
   → Iterable API calls (users/update, lists/subscribe, etc.)

3. Verify whether:
   - Iterable is intentionally skipped for CSV uploads
   - Iterable writes are gated behind a flag (e.g. sendEmail, source, isManual, etc.)
   - Iterable calls are failing silently
   - Iterable calls are batched, deferred, or queued
   - Errors are logged but not surfaced
   - The email field is missing, transformed, or invalid by the time it reaches Iterable

4. Check environment/config:
   - Iterable API key presence in this environment
   - Correct project ID
   - Any feature flags disabling Iterable writes for admin uploads

5. Add temporary instrumentation if needed:
   - Log when a CSV row attempts an Iterable write
   - Log the exact payload sent to Iterable
   - Log Iterable API responses or errors

6. Confirm whether the system currently:
   - Creates Iterable users only on self-registration
   - Skips Iterable entirely for admin-added or CSV-added users

7. Summarize findings clearly:
   - Exact reason users like ravmalik01@gmail.com do not exist in Iterable
   - Whether this is expected behavior or a bug
   - What would need to change to ensure CSV users are always created in Iterable (without sending email)

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT send any emails
- Do NOT backfill existing users
- Discovery and documentation only
- No behavior changes unless explicitly recommended in the findings

DELIVERABLE
- Write a clear root-cause analysis to Instructions.md
- Include:
  - Where the CSV → Iterable flow breaks
  - Whether the behavior is intentional or accidental
  - A recommended fix (but do not implement it yet)
