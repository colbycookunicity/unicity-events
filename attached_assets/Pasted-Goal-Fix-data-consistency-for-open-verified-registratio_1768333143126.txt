Goal:
Fix data consistency for open_verified registrations so that phone + distributorId entered on the public registration form are saved to the registrations table and are visible everywhere (admin attendee profile + admin lists + re-opening the public form).

Read:
- Instructions (10).md
- server/routes.ts
- server/storage.ts
- shared/schema.ts
- client/src/pages/RegistrationPage.tsx
- client/src/pages/AttendeesPage.tsx (and any attendee detail drawer/modal component)
- Any api client used by admin UI (client/src/lib/api.ts or similar)

Context (what’s broken):
1) Repro A (phone not visible in admin):
- Event: /register/academia-habilidades (open_verified)
- Register new user: colbycookux@gmail.com
- Enter phone on public form: +1 801 856 6299
- Submit “Actualizar Registro”
- Result: Public form shows the phone (and continues to show it on revisit)
- BUT admin attendee profile shows Phone = “-” (null)
Expected: Admin attendee profile shows +1 801 856 6299 (single source of truth = registrations.phone)

2) Repro B (admin has distributorId but public form shows blank):
- Login as colby.cook+3@unicity.com
- Public form shows blank name/phone/distributorId
- Admin shows distributorId=73737373
Expected: Public form should load DB registration record after OTP (existing registration) and display distributorId, names, phone.

3) Console noise:
GET /api/public/qualifier-info/academia-habilidades?email=... returns 404 repeatedly on open_verified events.
If this call is not needed for open_verified/open_anonymous, remove/guard it to avoid confusion.

What to do:
1) Trace the FULL data path for phone + distributorId:
- Public form input fields → form state
- Submit handler payload → POST endpoint (likely /api/register or /api/register/submit)
- Server request parsing/validation (Zod or similar)
- storage create/update call
- Actual DB columns written (registrations.phone, registrations.unicity_id, registrations.first_name, registrations.last_name)
- Admin GET endpoints used by attendee profile/list (GET /api/registrations, GET /api/registrations/:id)
- Admin UI mapping from API response → displayed fields

2) Identify why public form can display a phone that admin can’t:
Common suspects to confirm with code + logs:
- The public form is displaying phone from localStorage/session/verifiedProfile instead of DB.
- The POST payload uses a different field name (e.g., mobilePhone/phoneNumber) that the server ignores.
- The server writes to a different column (or JSON metadata) while admin reads registrations.phone.
- The admin API is omitting phone in SELECT/projection (storage layer returns no phone).
- The admin UI is reading a different property name than the API returns.

3) Make the registrations table the single source of truth (per Instructions (10).md):
- Ensure POST registration submit ALWAYS upserts phone + unicityId + first/last into registrations.* columns.
- Ensure GET /api/register/existing returns registrations.* and the public form uses that to populate fields after verification.
- Ensure admin GET endpoints return phone + unicityId consistently (both list + detail).
- Remove any fallback that can mask missing DB writes (no “fake success” where UI shows values that aren’t persisted).

4) Add targeted logging (temporary, but keep minimal in prod):
- On registration submit: log eventId, email, phone, unicityId, and whether it performed INSERT vs UPDATE + the registration.id.
- On admin read (GET /api/registrations/:id): log the loaded registration.id and phone/unicityId.
- On /api/register/existing: log loaded registration.id and phone/unicityId.
Use a consistent prefix like [DataFlow] so we can grep logs.

5) Fix /api/public/qualifier-info spam:
- In client, only call qualifier-info if event.registrationMode === "qualified_verified" (or whatever the qualified mode is called).
- Or on server return 200 with a clear payload for open modes (but prefer client guard).

Acceptance tests (must pass):
A) New registration phone persists:
- Register colbycookux@gmail.com with +1 801 856 6299
- Confirm DB row in registrations has phone='+1 801 856 6299'
- Admin attendee profile shows the same phone
- Admin list row (if shown) also includes phone or detail does

B) Admin edits reflect everywhere:
- As admin, edit phone to +1 0000000000
- Re-open public form after OTP verify → it shows +1 0000000000 (DB)
- No other “ghost phone” appears

C) Existing registration prefill works for open_verified:
- For colby.cook+3@unicity.com with distributorId=73737373 in DB
- After OTP verify, public form loads DB and displays distributorId + any stored fields (not blank)

Deliverables:
1) Implement the fixes with clean, minimal changes.
2) Update Instructions.md (or append to Instructions (10).md if that’s the canonical doc) with:
- Root cause
- Exact files changed
- How to reproduce before/after
- Why registrations.* is the source of truth
3) Include a short checklist for manual QA for the three acceptance tests above.

Constraints:
- Do NOT claim Hydra contains these phones; treat Hydra only as OTP verification/auth, not a data source for phone.
- Do NOT add new tables unless absolutely required (prefer fixing field mapping + persistence).
- Keep changes backward compatible for existing registrations.
