Goal:
Implement Phase 2 by adding an admin UI and backend support to configure per-event Iterable email campaigns (EN/ES) directly within the Events platform.

Instructions:
• Research my codebase
• Read Instructions.md fully before making changes
• Review the Phase 1 implementation for per-event campaign routing
• Find the event admin configuration models, APIs, and UI
• Write a detailed plan to Instructions.md BEFORE implementing
• Only implement after the plan is written and validated

Context:
• Phase 1 introduced per-event, per-language Iterable campaign routing
• Existing events still rely on environment variable defaults
• Phase 2 will allow admins to explicitly configure campaigns per event
• Iterable remains the source of email content
• Events platform only stores campaign IDs
• Hydra continues to own OTP and magic-link emails (do not modify)

Requirements:

Backend:
1. Add an admin-protected API endpoint to fetch available Iterable campaigns
   - Use Iterable API
   - Return only API-triggered campaigns
   - Include campaignId and campaignName
   - Prefer filtering by name prefix: "event:"

2. Extend event configuration to store email campaign mappings:
   emailType → language → campaignId
   (Do NOT remove existing env-based defaults)

3. Update email send logic to:
   - Prefer event-specific campaign mappings if present
   - Fall back to environment variables if not configured
   - Never fall back across events

Admin UI:
4. Add an "Emails" or "Email Campaigns" section to Event Admin
5. For each supported email type, allow:
   - Selecting an English campaign
   - Selecting a Spanish campaign
6. Populate dropdowns from the Iterable campaigns API
7. Display clear validation states:
   - Missing EN or ES campaign
   - Using fallback (env-based) configuration
8. Prevent saving invalid or incomplete configurations

Safety & Guardrails:
9. Do not allow selecting the same campaign for multiple events without warning
10. Log campaign selection clearly (eventSlug, emailType, language, campaignId)
11. Do not send emails if a required campaign is missing for an event
    - Log a warning instead
    - Never guess or reuse another event’s campaign

Documentation:
12. Update Instructions.md to include:
   - How admins configure campaigns per event
   - Required email types for an event to be “email-ready”
   - How fallback behavior works
   - How to add campaigns for a new event in Iterable

Constraints:
• No database schema changes unless absolutely necessary
• No breaking changes to existing events
• No changes to Hydra or authentication logic
• Follow existing admin auth and permission patterns
• Keep logic explicit, readable, and auditable

After writing the plan to Instructions.md:
STOP and wait for confirmation before implementing.
