Goal:
Implement market-based admin scoping SAFELY (no production disruption) by adding only backwards-compatible schema + scaffolding behind a disabled feature flag. Do NOT enforce any market restrictions yet.

Instructions:
• Research the existing codebase and read Instructions.md fully before making changes
• Implement changes in a way that public registration routes (/register/:slug) are completely unaffected
• Add a feature flag MARKET_SCOPING_ENABLED (default false) and ensure all new logic is gated behind it
• Make ONLY additive, backwards-compatible changes in this first pass
• Write a short rollout checklist at the top of Instructions.md describing how to enable later safely

Scope for this pass (IMPLEMENT):
1) Database (additive only)
   - Add events.market_code (nullable, indexed). Do NOT make it required yet.
   - Add users.assigned_markets (nullable text[] or json) to support future market_admin mapping.
   - If role enum changes are risky, do NOT change the enum yet; defer role rename/migration to a later pass.

2) Backend scaffolding (feature-flagged, non-enforced)
   - Create middleware requireMarketAccess(...) but make it a no-op when MARKET_SCOPING_ENABLED=false
   - Add helpers to read assigned markets from the user record
   - Do NOT change existing route protections yet (no filtering, no blocking)

3) Admin UI (optional, safe)
   - Add non-functional UI placeholders only if they do not affect existing pages (e.g., a hidden market filter behind the flag)
   - Do NOT change default event lists yet

Constraints:
• Do not modify public registration endpoints or behavior
• Do not filter or block any admin queries while the flag is false
• Avoid breaking migrations: all existing rows must remain valid without data backfill
• If anything is unclear, choose the safest backward-compatible approach

Deliverables:
• PR-quality code changes (migrations + feature flag + scaffolding)
• Update Instructions.md with:
  - what changed
  - how to backfill market_code later
  - how to enable MARKET_SCOPING_ENABLED safely in staging first
